    "**Objective:** This assignment will give you experience with NumPy genfromtext, Pandas, advanced plotting, and Cartopy.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Instructions:**\n",
    "Read through the following instructions carefully!\n",
    "### Accessing Class Code and Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a fork of the class repository in GitHub.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Clone this repository into the home directory of your own JupyterHub by running this command:\n",
    "```git clone your_SSH_URL```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Our JupyterHub server has trouble remembering the file permissions for our SSH keys. If you get a file permission error with your private ssh key, run the following line of code in your Terminal:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```chmod 400 ~/.ssh/id_ed25519``` \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "This will change your file permission to the proper permissions that SSH requires.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. There should now be a \"homework_3\" directory in the home directory of your JupyterHub. In terminal, change directories into \"homework_3\". Next, click on the the \"homework_3\" icon on the filepath hierarchy in the left panel of JupyterHub. If you don't see it, make sure you're in the home folder by clicking the folder icon under the search bar. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Double click the \"HW3.ipynb\" to open it in a new tab and begin working on the assignment. Read the instructions carefully, and make sure to write your answers in the specified cells. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. Make sure to use the answer variable names provided in the starter code. There are autograder tests embedded in the notebook that will check your work when you run the Autograder, and you can which tests you passed/failed after you submit.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Edit the **README** file and write your name and UW NetID. Add a paragraph on why the following plots elements (below) are necessary when designing figures (4-5 sentences). (5 points) \n",
    "\n",
    "6. As you continue to answer the homework questions and make edits to your code, make sure to regularly update your GitHub repository as well via git add, commit, and push. A good rule of thumb would be to run these git steps anytime you make an addition or change that you don't want to accidentally lose. Generally, you can push once a day to maintain good version control practices. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, make sure that your git commands are running without errors before you refresh your GitHub and check your changes. If you are not seeing the updated changes you created in your local JupyterHub directory, check where your status is by this command: <br>\n",
    "``` git status```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, you can see if you made an error with your git add, commit, or push commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Required Plot Elements for Figures\n",
    "This assignments requires you to create and design figures using `matplotlib`. To practice good plotting practices, each figure will require the following to receive full points:\n",
    "1) Concise, descriptive title for each figure/subplot\n",
    "2) Axis labels with units (when possible)\n",
    "3) Appropriate axis limits (minimum and maximum)\n",
    "4) Appropriate tick resolution\n",
    "5) Legend when using different datasets \n",
    "6) Appropriate font size (a good range is 12-15)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Storing your answers\n",
    "In the code cells where you will write your answers, there will be comments denoting:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"**# your code**\"\n",
    "\n",
    "and \n",
    "\n",
    "\"**# answer variables**\"\n",
    "\n",
    "You may store any intermediary variables in the **your code** section. If you do not have any intermediary variables, you can leave the \"your code\" section blank and store your answer directly in the answer variables.\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Submitting to GradeScope\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Add, commit, and push your changes to GitHub via the command line in JupyterHub.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Go to the class Gradescope dashboard and submit your personal GitHub repository link to the Homework 3 assignment. If prompted, log in to GitHub.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Run the autograder to check if your code runs and if you passed the initial unit tests. You should be able to run the autograder as many times as you want before submitting. Again, double check that your final answers are stored in the provided variable names given in the starter code!\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Once the autograder has finished running, check that you have submitted the assignment. If you make any more changes to your code after submitting to Gradescope, make sure to push your changes to GitHub and resubmit the assignment on Gradescope. You can submit as many times as you want as there is no maximum submission attempts, but be sure to have your final submission in before the deadline.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Honor Code\n",

As the sun sets and the water column darkens, they make their way to the food-rich surface. Sonar using backscattering data to predict where the zooplankton are at a given time. Higher backscattering values correlate to increased biomass. Note in the figure above how the surface shows high backscattering at the surface (dark red), but we can see another layer of lighter blue/green that represents zooplankton moving up and down.\n",
    "\n",
    "  During an eclipse at ~17:00 on August 21st 2017, as the moon blocked the sun’s light, the zooplankton began their nightly vertical migration through the water column. Once the moon moved passed the sun and light in the water column increase, the zooplankton realized their mistake and swam back down. Note that since the eclipse was such a short event, the zooplankton did not make it all the way to the surface.\n",
